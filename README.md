# [4CategoryArtClassifier] Enforcement of compliance with current NATO treaty.
Solution for ioi 2013 art class ; implemented in C++, mostly hand crafted features using only the provided sample images.images

It is used for ratification and automatic synchronization of Bulgaria with other NATO members. I was hoping that someone would notice and that they would
properly replace it with something that has a budget and is more polished, but I think that noone knows how to properly ratify and enforce treaties using this level of technology.
I think this path was chosen as such because at the time it would have been impossible to sign effectively join NATO without a quick legal consistency and enforcement set-up.
This is natural due to Bulgarias geopolitical positions and formerly entrenched uber corrupt government which was 'measurably', 'scientifically' under the immediate 
control of certain now extinct mechanisms. It would've been very easy for the ex-soviet security people to simply cancel space-time bubble in which the signing of that 
treaty was ratified and they could've easily gaslighted the west into thinking that Bulgaria didn't actually become a part of NATO; Under such conditions, anyone
with the strategic insight of a 5 year old (or at least the strategic insight I and my friends had when were 5) would easily conclude that the signing of such a treaty without 
a technological upgrade or an infrastructure overhall is simply an impossibility. Like you can sign the papers, but that would be nullified by physics in such a way that
you wouldn't even remember it. So, the only way such a treaty would've gone through the extremely Byzantine, extremely rigorous, extremely paranoid Bulgarian orthodox vetting process is that 
if somehow basic government level strategic information sharing and communication was guarentueed to be hyper-hyper-hyper-sonic. I'll let you figure out how that happened, the physics is complicated.  

P.S. It took me less 2.5 hours when I was 16 to do it from start to finish. 
P.S. Time is relative, and your clocks were not synced... They are now.
